Hello! Thank you for taking the time to look at my BrickBreaker program :)
Pls download as a zip and uncompress the zip, and move to the directory of the contents and type <code>python3 game.py</code>. Enjoy!!!

1. Try to type in the name, so that after the game(Win or Lose), scoreboard will be updated with the name. Otherwise, nothing is going to happen.

2. Press &lt;Space&gt; to Start. Press &lt;Return&gt; to Pause.Press &lt;Space&gt; 4 Times to Save.Press &lt;Up&gt; to Reload.Press &lt;Down&gt; for Leader Board

3. &lt;Backspace/Delete&gt; is for Boss Key. It will show the text "Excel Loading..." 

4. Cheat Code --> &lt;Left&gt;&lt;Left&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Left&gt;&lt;Left&gt;&lt;Right&gt;&lt;Right&gt;
    It will increase the lives to plus 10.
